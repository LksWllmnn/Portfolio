                    <h2>Bachelorthesis - Remote Rendering</h2>
                    <p>Since the beginning of September 2022 I am working on a remote rendering component in Unity for the application MARBLE which runs on the HoloLens2. The goal of this work is to show if it is possible to create a component for the application that implements the principle of remote rendering and what difficulties it can cause. The concept of remote rendering describes that a complex model is rendered on an outsourced computing unit and the result is transferred to the client so that the client does not have to bear the computing load for the rendering process.</p>
                    <p>I work with the MRTK and the Mixed Reality WebRTC Package from Microsoft.  In the practical part of the work, I focus on which data has to be streamed, how to build up the scene so that a 3D image is created from the streamed data, how to get the data from the depth buffer, transfer it and integrate it again, and chromakeying so that the object integrates well into the scene.</p>

                    <p>Realtime BeerPhong was a project for the Real-Time Computer Graphics module. The project was the final project of the course and our team implemented it in about 2 months. The assignment was to create an AR application using WebGL or a library based on WebGL. We decided to implement the game Beer Pong in our application. Special features of the project were learning new techniques like working on shaders can be very intimidating at the beginning but with time very fascinating.</p>
                    <p>In the project I was very involved in coordinating our group, programming shaders and researching 3D libraries that were interesting for our application.</p>

                    <p>Like Realtime BeerPhong, the Shader Solar System was created in the Realtime Computer Graphics module. The task was to get acquainted with the Shadertoy tool and develop a shader within a week. Within two long days I designed the idea and implemented the shader. I concentrated on the shadows of the planets to make them look like 3D models although they exist only on pixel basis.</p>
                    <p>What I find fascinating about shader coding is that the graphics card can really calculate the information for each pixel in an incredibly short time.</p>

                    <p>SudokuKing was developed in the Mobile App Development module in the summer semester 22/23 in collaboration with a fellow student. He focused on the development of the iOS app and I focused on the Android version. The app should be a puzzle app to pass the time of the user. Due to the fact that our concept was too large, we were unfortunately not able to embed actual puzzles at the end. However, you can theoretically play Sudoku games with the app. The course gave me great insights into the process of app development.</p>
                    <p>During the implementation, I worked on every single step from concept to creation. With the help of Figma, I created wireframes and screens of how the app should look later. For software design, I used the Data, Domain, Presentation model. For the creation of the UI I used Jetpack Composed. For data management I worked with the Room Database.</p>

The customer Cowa wanted to create a teaching application for its employees. The application should be a VR application as well as a browser application to serve as many employees as possible. So it was decided to create a cardboard application that would take the user on a guided tour of a building and have him solve various puzzles like in a "Point and Click" game to learn the information to be conveyed.</p>
                    <p>I was asked to take over the development part and to implement the concept. For this I had to learn how krPano and JavaScript work together, develop the software architecture and create the logic for the different puzzles.</p>

"A Fraction of Time" is a 3D puzzle game in which the player controls a scientist and has to guide him through different levels while solving puzzles. The puzzles can only be solved by manipulating different time periods using the different egos of the scientist.</p>
                    <p>In the project, I worked with my team members on the concept for the game. Also, in the development, I took care of the character's controls, the integration of sound effects, as well as the UI design and development of the UI interface.</p>

Schanze & Horn worked with Wordpress, the Beaverbuilder, PHP, JavaScript and of course CSS and HTML. For the creation there were layouts for websites, which could be redesigned depending on the customer.</p>
                    <p>During the creation of the site, I had to think of a CI for the client, using his old website as a guide. With the help of the Beaverbuilder, there were already some modules that you could simply drag and drop onto the page, but you had to help out with JavaScript and PHP from time to time if you wanted to have functionalities that were not standard.</p>
